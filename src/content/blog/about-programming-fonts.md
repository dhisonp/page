# About Programming Fonts

For whatever reason, I consider programming fonts to be one of the most
important aspects of my coding journey. Without a good font, I simply refuse to
code (well, unless it's my day job). It simply takes the joy out of it. Spacing,
font sizes, families, and everything; I've researched it way too much, to the
point where I start reading late 20th century typography theses.

My friend called me an 'aesthetic-based' engineer. He's not wrong. As much as I
love features and functionality, I prefer my environment, which includes my
physical table, my room, my playlist, and my editor to look nice.

Why? If you're going to look at this thing for more than 4 hours a day then you
may as well make it look pretty.

So... I decided to write something about it. These are my personal top 7
programming fonts, in order, prioritizing these as the deciding factors:

1. Readability
2. Design
3. Practicality

## General Tips

For whatever font you are using, I advise using _at least_ 14px of size with
~1.0-1.25x line height. To clarify, when I say 'line height', as I am not a
designer myself, I refer to the ratio between a full-height character and the
gap between the next/previous line. For example, in the following code block,
the space between each number on the individual lines should at least be
~1.0-1.25x the size of the numbers. I usually use `3` or `8` and see they at
least have that amount of spacing.

```
123458888
123458888
```

Your eyes will thank this, and of course, it will make the editor prettier.
Basic accessbility and UX stuff!

Now, let's get on to the list.

## 7. Source Code Pro

- Readability: 4/5
- Design: 4.5/5
- Practicality: 4/5

Ah yes, the days of Adobe Flash Player engineering. There's not much to say
about this: it's simple, pretty, and it works. It gives off the most
minimalistic vibes out of all the fonts listed below, which is an attribute I
appreciate. One criticism is that it gets a little thin and small over long
hours, which doesn't help if you're working overnight.

## 6. SF Mono

- Readability: 4.5/5
- Design: 4.5/5
- Practicality: 4.5/5

Apple's newest, modern font. Nothing much to say honestly â€“ you probably used
this font quite a few times without realizing. It's the default font that shows
on XCode, and on Safari on certain websites depending on how they style their
typography. It's sleek, looks modern, readable, and it works. It is a little
wider than the standard, but that can be good or bad depending on who you ask.
For me, I don't mind it. It's just a little boring, and I know another boring
font that does a better job than this. Solid font.

## 5. Geist Mono

- Design: 5/5
- Practicality: 4/5

What a beautiful font. Slap this thing onto _anything_ and it will look good. A
gym CSV log, your notepad, a college transcript, and your editor. It screams
chic, modern, and fashion-forward. It is probably the first or second in this
list in terms of sheer looks.

HOWEVER. It is slightly less easy to read over long hours compared to the others
on this list, putting this on a solid #5.

## 4. Hack (or Menlo)

![Hack](/images/about-programming-fonts/hack.png)

- Readability: 5/5
- Design: 3.5/5
- Practicality: 5/5

Cookie-cutter, standard, boring Menlo of the MacOS before SF Mono became their
favorite child. What is there to explain about Menlo/Hack? I decided to put them
together because of how similar they are. I prefer Hack since it felt
'smoother', but Menlo wins slightly in aesthetics since it feels more native and
retro. It doesn't look bad, and it is _extremely_ readable. I'd say the most
readable. It does look a little boring, but you cannot ask for a more reliable
font than these.

## 3. JetBrains Mono

- Readability: 4.5/5
- Design: 4.5/5
- Practicality: 4.5/5

The internet's new favorite child. JetBrains did a great job of making a font
that is both aesthetically pleasing and hyper-readable. From your AI startup
landing pages, NeoVim enthusiasts, and my local Italian cafe menu designer (yes,
I recognize JetBrains Mono from a cafe menu), this thing is loved by almost
everyone. Which is kinda funny because I remember it being lauded as unreadable,
but alas. Pretty and functional, what more can you ask for?

## 2. Iosevka

![Iosevka](/images/about-programming-fonts/iosevka.png)

- Readability: 4/5
- Design: 4.5/5
- Practicality: 5/5

Not going to lie, for the longest time I've thought this thing is overrated.
Then, one day I had to work on my small laptop screen for a week. Then, some
huge PRs and feature updates require me to have multiple windows at once... on
this screen. So I said screw it, let's do a condensed font. What started as a
pragmatic and reluctant choice ended up being an aesthetic one.

This website _only_ uses Iosevka (condensed, Fira Mono variant). People would
say customizability is the leading aspect of why this font is good, along with
it being open-source, but man, let's be honest, we don't really care too much
about that. These are nice, but ultimately it is for the same reason the others
are here: aesthetics and readability.

Despite it being smaller (condensed), I find it extremely comfortable to read
during long coding hours. In terms of functionality, it is the only font in this
list that allows you to fit more content onto your screen.

I don't have this font on all the time. On larger screens, I still prefer the
standard width fonts. However, I almost use Iosevka _everywhere_ at this point:
my gym log, my notes app, my website, and anywhere where a font can be picked.
It's extremely readable outside of code, and it looks pleasant. Great font.

## X. Honorable Mentions

- MonoLisa: Beautiful font and extremely readable, but it being a little too
  wide really hampers practicality.
- IBM Plex Mono: Beautiful font, but like Geist, it's not easy to look at over
  long hours, and Geist looks better.
- Pragmata Pro: Same reason as Iosevka, but a bit outdated and conflicts with
  some environments. I also prefer Iosevka's look.
- Fira Code: It can get a little busy, and it looks alright. However, it's
  extremely readable and comfortable to use.
- CommitMono: Very aesthetically pleasing and simple, but not really readable in
  the long run.

Some other fonts I've tried include Rec Mono, Maple Mono, mononoki, JuliaMono,
Google Sans Code, but let's not overcrowd the party here.

## 1. Berkeley Mono

- Readability: 4/5
- Design: 5/5
- Practicality: 4.5/5

Wow. I look at this and I say wow. I forgot where I got this, but it was some
documentation of some application I was trying to incorporate into one of my
projects, and _the moment_ I see this thing I press F12 on my Firefox and
immediately get the font. Tried the trial, stuck with it for a few days,
comparing it to other fonts and the other paid font (MonoLisa) to see if I want
to dump bank for this.

This is the best looking font, tied with Geist Mono, in this list. I like it. I
really, really, like it. I applied it to a bunch of CSVs including trip plans,
budgeting, gym plan, and they all suddenly look so aesthetic. So demure. So
classy. Retro and polished.

Ok, I should stop swooning.

Back to the topic. Aside from the looks, I personally find it decently readable.
Practically, too, it has the standard height and width found in JetBrains Mono
and the rest.

U.S. Graphics Company did an outstanding job on this font and I am stoked to see
them working on a new font, which I'll certainly try on day one!
