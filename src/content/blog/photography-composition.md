# The Art of Composition in Street Photography

Street photography is about capturing authentic moments. Composition is what transforms a snapshot into a compelling image.

## Rule of Thirds

While it's a basic principle, the rule of thirds remains powerful for creating balanced, engaging compositions.

## Leading Lines

Urban environments are full of natural leading lines - streets, buildings, shadows. Use them to guide the viewer's eye.

## Anticipation

The best street photography comes from anticipating moments before they happen. Position yourself where the light, background, and action align.

## Conclusion

Composition is a tool for storytelling. Every element in your frame should contribute to the narrative you're creating.
